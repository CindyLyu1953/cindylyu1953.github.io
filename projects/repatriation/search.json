    "text": "Our analysis reveals that repatriation under NAGPRA has often been reactive—spurred by legal mandates rather than proactive moral responsibility. To shift this trajectory, we recommend a more sustained, transparent, and ethically grounded commitment from institutions across all sectors.\nWe propose the following multi-stage action framework:\n\n\n\nPublicly acknowledge institutional histories of Indigenous dispossession, especially for universities established through land grants or scrip grants.\nConduct comprehensive audits of collections, identifying all Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and cultural patrimony.\nEstablish dedicated repatriation task forces within institutions, with formal authority and cross-departmental representation.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrioritize consultation with tribal nations, ensuring that repatriation efforts are guided by Indigenous leadership and sovereignty.\nPublish public-facing progress reports on inventories, consultations, and returns to promote transparency and accountability.\nSecure funding and resources specifically allocated for the repatriation process, including support for tribal consultation and logistical needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmbed repatriation commitments into institutional policy, ensuring that future acquisitions, stewardship, and educational practices are guided by ethical standards respecting Indigenous rights.\nEstablish enduring partnerships with Native communities through memoranda of understanding (MOUs), cultural exchange programs, and educational collaborations.\nIntegrate Indigenous perspectives and histories into curricula, exhibitions, and public communications—not as isolated acknowledgments, but as an ongoing re-centering of narrative and mission.\n\nBeyond compliance, repatriation must be embraced as a continuing practice of truth-telling, repair, and relationship-building. It is not merely a legal requirement, but a moral commitment—one that calls institutions to honor the past, restore dignity to Native communities, and reshape the future with integrity and accountability.\n\n\nOur analysis reveals a shared pattern: repatriation efforts often lagged until policy intervention, remained uneven across states, and varied widely among institutions.\nRegardless of place or affiliation, every institution—and every individual—carries a responsibility to reckon with this history.\nWe call for a deeper commitment: to honor the past not only through compliance, but through conscience; not merely in moments of gratitude, but through sustained action and remembrance.\nTrue repair demands more than gratitude—it demands return."

    "text": "The dispossession of Indigenous lands was not just an act of removal-it redrew the very map of the United States. In this section, we explore the geospatial story of repatriation: how different lands, once seized through acts like the Morrill Act, now bear the responsibility to return Native ancestors and heritage.\nBeginning with an examination of historical land transfers, and moving into an analysis of state-level repatriation efforts today, we trace how geography shapes both the burdens of the past and the possibilities for justice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1 - Morrill Act Land Area by State\nThis interactive choropleth map visualizes the land area (in acres) granted to each state under the Morrill Act, which played a pivotal role in shaping the foundation of many land-grant universities. By hovering over a state, you can view the state code along with the specific land area awarded.\n\n\n\nThe color gradient highlights significant disparities in land allocations. Darker shades indicate states that received a larger amount of land. Notably, California, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Michigan, Minnesota, and Kansas stand out with the most substantial Morrill Act land holdings. These patterns reveal the geographic concentration of lands seized from Indigenous peoples to fund educational institutions—an important historical context for understanding universities’ heightened ethical responsibilities in current repatriation efforts.\n\n\nStarting with the lands ceded under the Morrill Act, we first examine where dispossession laid its deepest roots. From there, we shift our focus to the present, explore how repatriation efforts vary across modern state lines. By comparing historical land seizures with contemporary acts of return, we glimpse both continuity and change in the ongoing journey toward restitution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2 - Repatriation Trends by State\nThis interactive visualization presents the annual trends of repatriated items by U.S. state. You can explore the repatriation activity of any of the 50 states by selecting from the dropdown menu. The chart includes a main plot with a range slider view below, enabling users to dynamically adjust the time window and focus on specific historical periods. Because the y-axis is fixed across all states, you can also make meaningful comparisons between state-level performances. This design invites both targeted exploration and broad comparison, helping audiences uncover disparities in institutional responsiveness at the state level.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia, Massachusetts, and New York emerge as the top three states in terms of cumulative repatriation activity. All three show noticeable spikes in recent years, particularly in 2022–2024, aligning with the nationwide surge following the updated NAGPRA regulations.\n\nCalifornia leads by a wide margin, peaking at over 160 repatriations in 2024. As the state with some of the largest museum and university collections—including UC system campuses and cultural institutions—California’s leadership reflects both historical accumulation and recent pressure to take action.\nMassachusetts shows an earlier spike around 2001, suggesting a longer history of institutional engagement, but its recent activity also increases sharply, likely involving major universities and museums based in Boston.\nNew York has a steadier but upward trend, consistent with its large academic and museum landscape.\n\nThese three states highlight how institutional concentration, public scrutiny, and local Indigenous advocacy may jointly shape repatriation outcomes.\n\n\n\nDespite the progress seen in a few leading states, the majority of U.S. states show minimal or stagnant repatriation activity throughout the timeline. In many cases, annual counts remain in the single digits or zero. This reflects persistent institutional inertia, under-resourced inventories, or even complete inaction in states with smaller collections or fewer regulatory pressures.\n\n\n\nWhile not in the top three, states like Washington and Wisconsin demonstrate modest yet visible efforts. Washington exhibits a steady climb starting in around 2006, peaking around 2013 and again in 2024. Wisconsin presents a scattered pattern with minor peaks in 2014, 2018, and 2022. These examples highlight that regional actors can make meaningful progress, though consistent commitment remains rare.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3 - Total Repatriation by State\nThis interactive choropleth map provides a geographic overview of repatriation activity across all 50 U.S. states. By hovering over each state, you can view its name, state code, and total number of repatriated items in detail. The map serves as a visual complement to the time-series line chart, allowing for quick comparison of cumulative totals at a glance.\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, California stands out with the darkest shading, corresponding to about 2.4 million repatriated items—largely due to recent large-scale returns by institutions like Sacramento State. Most other states remain relatively light in color, highlighting disparities in institutional engagement across the country.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4 - Pending Repatriation by State\nThis interactive map visualizes the number of pending repatriation cases across U.S. states, with options to toggle between Individuals, Funerary Objects, and Total counts. By hovering over a specific state, users can view the state name and the exact pending item count. This functionality enables a detailed examination of where the unfinished work of repatriation remains most urgent.\n\n\n\nWhen viewed alongside the total repatriation map, a clear contrast emerges. Ohio stands out as a notable example—despite some repatriation activity, the state still holds an exceptionally high number of pending returns, far exceeding what has been completed. States such as Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and California, while having demonstrated significant repatriation efforts, continue to retain substantial numbers of unrepatriated remains and cultural objects.\nThis discrepancy reveals that many institutions have made only partial efforts, leaving thousands of ancestors and cultural items in limbo. The map underscores a broader challenge: repatriation is not simply about symbolic gestures, but requires sustained, systematic commitment to justice and healing.\n\n\nOur geospatial analysis reveals both encouraging progress and persistent disparities in the repatriation of Native American ancestors and cultural items.\nWhile a few states—such as California, Massachusetts, and New York—have demonstrated leadership in returning items, many others have shown only minimal activity over time. In numerous states, the volume of unrepatriated individuals and objects continues to exceed what has been returned. Even in states with visible efforts, significant unfinished obligations remain.\nTaken together, these visualizations highlight a key insight: progress has been uneven, and historical injustices persist both in scale and geography. Repatriation is not a task completed, but an ongoing responsibility that demands sustained institutional accountability."

    "text": "The relationship between U.S. institutions and Indigenous communities is deeply shaped by a long history of land dispossession and cultural erasure. From forced relocations and unequal treaties to policies like the Morrill Act of 1862, Indigenous lands were systematically seized to build state infrastructure—including the very universities and museums that now serve as stewards of American knowledge. While these institutions have long benefited from such legacies, the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in 1990 marked a critical turning point—mandating the return of Native American ancestral remains and cultural items. To understand current repatriation efforts, we must first trace how land was taken, how universities profited, and how restitution is now being pursued."

    "text": "1. Indigenous Land Dispossession in the U.S.\nIndigenous land dispossession in the U.S. refers to the historical and ongoing process of taking or using Indigenous land without consent, leading to significant loss of land, cultural disruption, and intergenerational trauma.\n\n\n\nFigure 0.1 - Indigenous Land Dispossession\n\n\nSource: Indigenous Land Dispossession\nThe history of Indigenous land dispossession began with European colonization and was institutionalized through federal policies such as the Indian Removal Act of 1830 (Library of Congress, n.d.) and later, the General Allotment Act of 1887 (Dawes Act) (National Archives, n.d.), which facilitated the transfer of tribal lands to white settlers and the federal government. During the 19th century, treaties—often signed under duress or later violated—were used to legitimize massive territorial seizures. By the early 20th century, the vast majority of Indigenous land had been taken.\n\n\n\nFigure 0.2 - The Indian Removal Act of 1830, signed into law by President Andrew Jackson\n\n\nSource: Andrew Jackson\n\n\n\nFigure 0.3 - An Act to Provide for the Allotment of Lands in Severalty to Indians on the Various Reservations (General Allotment Act or Dawes Act), Statutes at Large 24, 388-91, NADP Document A1887.\n\n\nSource: Dawes Act\nAs a result, almost all Indigenous peoples living in the eastern United States were forcibly relocated to the west, often confined to designated areas in Oklahoma, the Great Plains, and the intermontane basins (Watson, Schaetzl, Zelinsky, & Hoffman, 2025). Based on statistics, indigenous land holdings have been reduced by approximately 99% from their historical territories. Also, the lands to which Indigenous peoples were relocated are often more susceptible to climate change and possess fewer natural resources compared to their original territories. This forced migration not only led to significant cultural and economic disruptions but also placed Indigenous communities in environments that pose greater challenges for sustainability and resilience.

    "text": "2. The Morrill Act of 1862 and Land-Grant Universities\nThe Morrill Act, signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on July 2, 1862, was a landmark piece of legislation that granted federal land to U.S. states to help fund the establishment of colleges focused on agriculture and the mechanic arts. The goal was to make higher education more accessible to the working class, especially in practical fields like farming, engineering, and military science, instead of being limited to classical studies available at elite institutions. (National Archives, n.d.)\nEach eligible state received 30,000 acres of public land per Congressional representative, which could be sold to generate funding for at least one college. This law ultimately laid the foundation for the land-grant university system, which includes many of today’s major public universities (e.g., Cornell, MIT, Texas A&M, etc.). (National Archives, n.d.)\n\n\n\nFigure 0.4 - Act of July 2, 1862 (Morrill Act), Public Law 37-108, which established land grant colleges, 07/02/1862; Enrolled Acts and Resolutions of Congress, 1789-1996; Record Group 11; General Records of the United States Government; National Archives.\n\n\nSource: Morrill Act\nIn recent years, scholars and advocates have increasingly scrutinized the legacy of the Morrill Act, particularly its role in facilitating the transfer of Indigenous lands to fund white-serving educational institutions. Research shows that these lands were often obtained through unjust treaties, land seizures, and coerced agreements, with little or no compensation provided to the Native communities involved (Goodluck, Ahtone, & Lee, 2020). Many universities continue to benefit from these historical injustices—not only through their physical occupation of Indigenous lands but also through the retention of Native remains and cultural artifacts, frequently without consultation or repatriation efforts (Stewart-Ambo, 2021).\nWhile institutional accountability remains limited, some universities have begun to take preliminary steps toward reconciliation. These efforts include implementing land acknowledgment statements, offering scholarships for Indigenous students, returning portions of land to tribal nations, and developing collaborative language and cultural programs in partnership with Native communities (San Juan College, 2024; ESU, n.d.; LeBlanc, S., 2024; Walker, A. R., 2024). Such actions signal a growing, if still uneven, awareness of the need to address the enduring impacts of settler colonialism within higher education.\n\n\n\nFigure 0.5 - Cherokee Indians were enrolled in Trinity College (left) ’s Industrial Indian boarding school; Duke University (right).\n\n\nSource: Trinity College and Duke University"

    "text": "3. NAGPRA (Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act)\nNAGPRA stands for the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, a federal law passed in the United States in 1990. It provides a legal process for federally funded institutions (like museums and universities) to return Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural patrimony to affiliated tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations (National Park Service, 2024).\n\n\n\nFigure 0.6 - Courtesy of Museum of Us\n\n\nSource: NAGPRA\nIn 2024, the United States made significant strides in repatriating Native American human remains under the NAGPRA. According to ProPublica (Hudetz, 2025), over 10,300 ancestors were returned to tribal nations, making 2024 the third-largest repatriation year since NAGPRA was enacted in 1990. These actions reflect growing accountability and institutional commitment to complying with NAGPRA’s mandates, especially following new federal rules introduced in late 2023 to streamline and accelerate repatriation processes.\nHowever, major gaps remain. As of early 2025, the ProPublica’s NAGPRA Repatriation Database indicates that approximately 42% of the reported Native American remains have not been made available for return (ProPublica, 2025), underscoring ongoing challenges in fully implementing NAGPRA’s mandates.\n\n\n\nFigure 0.7 - 42% of remains have not been made available to tribes\n\n\nSource: ProPublica’s NAGPRA Repatriation Database\nNAGPRA is not only about returning physical items—it is about respect, sovereignty, healing, and justice. It affirms Indigenous communities’ rights to their ancestors and sacred traditions, and challenges the colonial legacy of museums and academia."

    "text": "4. Conclusion\nTogether, these three areas—land dispossession, the establishment of land-grant universities, and the legal framework of NAGPRA—form the historical and institutional backdrop against which our project is built. By contextualizing how land was taken and repurposed, and how current institutions respond to that legacy, we hope to shed light on patterns of institutional accountability and resistance. This background not only informs our visual analysis but also invites audiences to critically examine the ethical and historical responsibilities of universities and museums in confronting their colonial pasts and committing to genuine restitution."

    "text": "The repatriation of Native American ancestors and cultural heritage is not only a geographic or temporal journey—it is also deeply institutional. Behind every item returned or withheld stands an organization: a university, a museum, a federal agency, or a historical center, each shaped by unique histories and responsibilities.\nThis section explores repatriation through an institutional lens, beginning broadly with types of institutions and then narrowing our focus to universities—particularly those shaped by the Morrill Act of 1862 and its aftermath.\nUnder this act, land-grant universities were established by granting federal lands—lands appropriated from Indigenous peoples—to fund public education. Meanwhile, scrip-grant universities received vouchers (“scrip”) to sell lands, often distant from their locations, converting Indigenous land into financial assets. Both models entwined higher education with dispossession.\nThrough this exploration, we ask: How have these institutions reckoned with the legacies they inherited?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1 - Repatriation by Institution Type\nThis interactive bar chart allows you to toggle between viewing the total number of repatriated items and the average number of items repatriated per institution within each category. By examining both total and per-institution averages, we gain a more nuanced understanding of institutional contributions, and disparities, in fulfilling NAGPRA’s mission.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcluding the miscellaneous “Other” category, four types of institutions stand out for their total repatriation numbers: universities, museums, federal agencies, and national parks/monuments. Among them, universities are particularly prominent, accounting for over 1.19 million repatriated items. This is significant given that many universities, especially land-grant institutions established under the Morrill Act of 1862, directly benefited from the seizure of Indigenous lands. Their historical accumulation of Native American remains and cultural objects places them under a heightened moral and ethical responsibility to lead in the repatriation process. Museums and federal agencies also show substantial total returns, reflecting their large legacy collections. National parks and monuments, though smaller in scale, have contributed meaningfully relative to their collection sizes, often working closely with tribal nations during recent regulatory updates.\n\n\n\nWhen switching to the average repatriation per institution, an interesting shift occurs. State agencies, despite lower total numbers, demonstrate a higher per-institution average than universities, museums or federal entities. This suggests that when state agencies do engage with NAGPRA compliance, they often do so with greater thoroughness on a per-institution basis. Conversely, while museums have high overall totals, their average repatriation per institution remains modest, reflecting a wide variance in institutional engagement within that sector.\nOverall, the visualization highlights both the concentration of responsibility—heavily weighted toward universities and major museums—and the variable intensity of commitment across different types of institutions.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2 - Pending Repatriation by Institution Type\nThis interactive bar chart allows you to switch between viewing the total pending repatriations and the average pending cases per institution within each category. It provides a critical lens on the unfinished work of repatriation, highlighting which types of institutions still retain significant numbers of Native American remains and cultural objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of total pending repatriations, universities again stand out, with over 265,000 individuals and over 44,000 funerary objects awaiting return. Museums and historical centers also show substantial pending counts, each holding more than 150,000 items collectively.\n\n\n\nWhen examining average pending repatriations per institution, historical centers and state agencies reveal notable patterns. While fewer in number, these institutions often hold relatively high quantities per organization, which indicates concentrated, unresolved holdings that require urgent attention.\nTaken together, the visualization paints a sobering picture: many institutions that historically amassed Native American materials have yet to fully reckon with their responsibilities under NAGPRA. Universities, in particular, face an ethical imperative—given their historical ties to land dispossession—to accelerate the return of ancestors and sacred objects.\nThis analysis also complements the earlier findings on completed repatriations: while some progress has been made, a vast amount of work remains, and institutional inertia continues to be a major barrier to justice and healing.\n\n\nHaving seen the varied engagement across types of institutions, from universities to museums to federal agencies, we now turn a sharper gaze toward universities themselves.\nNot all universities are alike: some were built atop land taken directly from Native nations, while others profited more distantly through land sales. Their historical pathways, whether land-grant or scrip-grant, carry different patterns of complicity, and, as the data reveal, profoundly different patterns of accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3 - Cumulative Growth of Universities by Grant Type\nThis interactive line chart tracks the cumulative number of universities over time, categorized by their grant type: land-grant universities and scrip-grant universities. By hovering over any point on the lines, users can view the exact year and the total cumulative number of universities established by that point in time.\n\n\n\nThe visualization reveals two important trends. First, scrip-grant universities began appearing earlier and expanded steadily, reflecting early patterns of land commodification through sale rather than direct use. Second, the passage of the Morrill Act in 1862 triggered a rapid proliferation of land-grant universities, marking a new phase of state-supported expansion deeply tied to Indigenous dispossession.\nTogether, these patterns tell a deeper story: as universities expanded, often through lands appropriated from Native nations, their obligations toward repatriation deepened.\n\n\nFigure 3.4 - Historical Profile of Land-Grant and Scrip-Grant Universities\nThis interactive dual-panel visualization offers two complementary views of university histories and their repatriation efforts. On the left, a box plot displays the distribution of founding years for land-grant and scrip-grant universities. Hovering over each box reveals the minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum founding years—enabling close comparison of institutional timelines. On the right, a donut chart shows the proportion of total university repatriations by grant type. The two panels are linked: clicking a grant type in the legend will filter the donut chart accordingly, allowing users to isolate and examine repatriation patterns specific to land-grant or scrip-grant institutions.\n\n\n\nBuilding on the cumulative history, this visualization examines how land-grant and scrip-grant universities differ in their historical foundations and repatriation engagement.\nThe box plot shows that land-grant universities cluster tightly around the late 19th century, consistent with the immediate impact of the Morrill Act. Scrip-grant universities, by contrast, span a broader historical range, some founded as early as the late 18th century.\nMeanwhile, the donut chart on the right reveals a striking asymmetry. A full 98% of documented university repatriations—1,358 in total—originate from land-grant institutions. In contrast, scrip-grant universities account for only 28 repatriations, despite their historical accumulation of wealth through land sales.\nTogether, these charts highlight a powerful asymmetry. Land-grant universities, built directly atop appropriated Indigenous territories, have begun addressing their responsibilities. Scrip-grant universities, though equally tied to colonial land extraction, largely remain absent from this moral reckoning..\n\n\nFigure 3.5 - University Establishment vs. Historical Endowment and Repatriation Efforts\nThis interactive bubble plot visualizes universities based on three dimensions: their founding year (x-axis), their historical endowment in 1914 (y-axis, log scale), and the number of repatriated individuals (bubble size). By hovering over each bubble, users can view detailed information for each university, including its name, year founded, historical endowment, total repatriated individuals, and annual repatriation rate.\n\n\n\nZooming further into individual institutions, this plot maps universities by founding year, historical endowment (as of 1914), and repatriation activity.\nAmong all institutions, only Michigan State University, Kansas State University, and Washington State University stand out with significantly larger bubbles, reflecting active repatriation efforts. In contrast, the vast majority of universities form a cloud of much smaller circles, indicating zero recorded repatriated individuals and an annual repatriation rate of zero.\nThis visualization highlights an uncomfortable truth: although many universities benefited historically from substantial land-based endowments, especially those established under the Morrill Act, most have made little to no effort toward repatriating Native ancestors. The landscape of responsibility is highly uneven, raising critical questions about historical accountability and institutional inertia.\n\n\nFigure 3.6 - Additional Combine Analysis: Pace of Expansion vs. Depth of Accountability\nThis combined visualization of Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.5 allows you to explore university repatriation histories from two interconnected perspectives: time and scale. On the same plot, bubble sizes represent the number of individuals repatriated by each university, while the dotted lines track the cumulative number of institutions established by grant type—land or scrip. By clicking on the legend, you can isolate either grant type, filtering the view to show only land-grant or scrip-grant universities. The legend also allows toggling between the bubble plot and the cumulative trend lines, offering flexible perspectives on institutional growth and responsibility.\n\n\n\nTo conclude our institutional analysis and offer an integrated perspective, this unified view brings together two key narratives of university history—the pace of expansion and the depth of accountability. Together, they underscore the enduring gap between institutional growth and the moral reckoning still required.\n\n\nOur institutional analysis exposes a landscape of uneven reckoning.\nUniversities, especially land-grant institutions founded through the Morrill Act, emerge both as primary beneficiaries of Indigenous dispossession and as key actors—however imperfect—in the repatriation movement. Museums, historical centers, and federal agencies also shoulder significant responsibilities, though with widely varying levels of engagement.\nYet across all types and histories, one truth echoes: the moral debt incurred through the acquisition of Native lands and ancestors has not yet been fully paid. The act of repatriation is not simply a matter of policy compliance, but a profound act of justice and healing. It demands not occasional gestures, but sustained, institutionalized commitment—rooted in historical understanding and ethical responsibility.\nAs we move forward, the question remains: Will institutions confront not only their collections, but their origins—and choose to become sites of repair rather than silence?"

    "text": "The passage of NAGPRA in 1990 marked a legal commitment to the repatriation of Native American remains and cultural heritage. However, the pace and pattern of repatriation have varied significantly over time. In this section, we examine how repatriation efforts have unfolded year by year, focusing not only on total numbers but also on the different categories of items being returned—such as individuals, funerary objects, sacred items, and cultural patrimony. Through these trends, we reveal how policy changes, institutional actions, and historical reckonings have shaped the tempo of justice.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1 - Repatriation by Year\nThis visualization is an interactive line chart that allows users to explore the repatriation trends by different object categories. By selecting from the dropdown menu on the right—such as Individuals, Funerary Objects, Sacred Objects, or Cultural Patrimony—you can dynamically update the chart to focus on specific types of repatriated items. This functionality enables a deeper, comparative exploration of how different categories have contributed to the overall patterns of repatriation across time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive line chart visualizes the total number of repatriated items each year since NAGPRA’s enactment. A key pattern is the dramatic peak in 2024, with over 1.73 million items repatriated—significantly higher than any previous year. This spike corresponds to the implementation of updated NAGPRA regulations under the Biden administration, alongside intensified institutional efforts, reflecting growing federal pressure and moral accountability.\n\n\n\nThis chart shows the number of Native American ancestral remains repatriated annually. Two major peaks stand out—one around 1998, and a larger one in 2023. The first surge follows a collaborative effort between the U.S. Navy and the Bishop Museum to return over 3,000 ancestral remains from Mokapu Peninsula, Oʻahu. The second peak reflects the Tennessee Valley Authority’s return of over 4,800 remains in 2023, which is one of the largest NAGPRA actions in the region. These spikes signal how institutional collaboration and legal pressure can translate into large-scale restitutions of ancestral dignity.\n\n\n\nThis chart reveals a dramatic increase in the number of funerary objects returned in 2024, largely driven by Sacramento State’s repatriation of over 1.28 million items following a campus-wide investigation. The magnitude of this return underscores both the scale of past accumulation and the power of institutional accountability in response to scrutiny and new federal guidance.\n\n\n\nThis chart illustrates the annual count of unassociated funerary objects—those not clearly tied to specific individuals. A pronounced spike in 2017 marks the reporting of over 55,000 such items by the Army Corps of Engineers, from a 1961 excavation in South Dakota later linked to the Yankton Sioux Tribe. The return of these objects, despite uncertain provenance, reflects an ethical shift toward restitution even in the absence of complete documentation.\n\n\n\nThis chart tracks the number of sacred items returned each year under NAGPRA. A notable spike occurs in 2005, when the National Park Service facilitated the repatriation of sacred objects from Chaco Culture National Historical Park to the Pueblo of Zia. Although the numbers remain relatively low, each instance holds immense spiritual significance, often requiring deep consultation and ceremonial respect, which makes every return a powerful act of cultural restoration.\n\n\n\nThis chart highlights the return of items classified as cultural patrimony—those of collective importance to tribal nations. A peak in 2024 corresponds with Sacramento State’s return of remains and funerary objects originally taken in 1978. These items, representing communal heritage rather than individual ownership, symbolize a deeper institutional recognition of Indigenous cultural sovereignty and the need to reconcile with long-ignored histories.\n\n\n\nThis chart shows the number of items repatriated each year that were identified as both sacred objects and cultural patrimony—dual-classification categories under NAGPRA. A distinct peak appears in 2024, when the Oakland Museum of California announced the return of 332 such items. This case stands out not only for its volume, but also for its complexity: dual-tagged objects often embody both ceremonial and communal significance, making their classification and rightful return especially meaningful. This moment represents one of the largest and most symbolically layered repatriation efforts under NAGPRA to date.\n\n\nFigure 1.2 - Repatriation by Year with Breakdown\nThis interactive visualization consists of two linked components: the upper line chart displays the total number of repatriated items by year, while the lower bar chart provides a detailed breakdown of repatriated item types (e.g., Individuals, Funerary Objects, Unassociated Funerary Objects, Sacred Objects, Cultural Patrimony, and Dual-Classified Items) for a selected year. Clicking on a specific year in the line chart dynamically updates the bar chart below, allowing viewers to explore how the composition of repatriated items varies year by year.\n\n\n\n\nAcross most years, funerary objects consistently represent the largest share of repatriated items, reflecting the historical prevalence of funerary artifacts in institutional holdings. Although there are fluctuations, funerary objects overwhelmingly dominate repatriation activity compared to other categories like sacred objects or cultural patrimony. This pattern highlights an ongoing need to address broader categories of Indigenous cultural heritage in repatriation efforts.\n\n\nThe temporal trends reveal a long period of stagnation, punctuated by a recent and dramatic increase in repatriation activity, particularly in 2023 and 2024. These shifts align with regulatory reform, public pressure, and growing ethical accountability. However, the data also expose decades of institutional inertia and missed opportunities. While the upward trend offers hope, it also calls for sustained and comprehensive commitment. Repatriation must not be a one-time surge, but a continuous, institutionalized practice of justice and healing, and one that fully addresses all categories of Indigenous cultural heritage."

    "text": "The passage of NAGPRA in 1990 marked a legal commitment to the repatriation of Native American remains and cultural heritage. However, the pace and pattern of repatriation have varied significantly over time. In this section, we examine how repatriation efforts have unfolded year by year, focusing not only on total numbers but also on the different categories of items being returned—such as individuals, funerary objects, sacred items, and cultural patrimony. Through these trends, we reveal how policy changes, institutional actions, and historical reckonings have shaped the tempo of justice.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1 - Repatriation by Year\nThis visualization is an interactive line chart that allows users to explore the repatriation trends by different object categories. By selecting from the dropdown menu on the right—such as Individuals, Funerary Objects, Sacred Objects, or Cultural Patrimony—you can dynamically update the chart to focus on specific types of repatriated items. This functionality enables a deeper, comparative exploration of how different categories have contributed to the overall patterns of repatriation across time."

    "text": "This interactive line chart visualizes the total number of repatriated items each year since NAGPRA’s enactment. A key pattern is the dramatic peak in 2024, with over 1.73 million items repatriated—significantly higher than any previous year. This spike corresponds to the implementation of updated NAGPRA regulations under the Biden administration, alongside intensified institutional efforts, reflecting growing federal pressure and moral accountability.\n\n\n\nThis chart shows the number of Native American ancestral remains repatriated annually. Two major peaks stand out—one around 1998, and a larger one in 2023. The first surge follows a collaborative effort between the U.S. Navy and the Bishop Museum to return over 3,000 ancestral remains from Mokapu Peninsula, Oʻahu. The second peak reflects the Tennessee Valley Authority’s return of over 4,800 remains in 2023, which is one of the largest NAGPRA actions in the region. These spikes signal how institutional collaboration and legal pressure can translate into large-scale restitutions of ancestral dignity.\n\n\n\nThis chart reveals a dramatic increase in the number of funerary objects returned in 2024, largely driven by Sacramento State’s repatriation of over 1.28 million items following a campus-wide investigation. The magnitude of this return underscores both the scale of past accumulation and the power of institutional accountability in response to scrutiny and new federal guidance.\n\n\n\nThis chart illustrates the annual count of unassociated funerary objects—those not clearly tied to specific individuals. A pronounced spike in 2017 marks the reporting of over 55,000 such items by the Army Corps of Engineers, from a 1961 excavation in South Dakota later linked to the Yankton Sioux Tribe. The return of these objects, despite uncertain provenance, reflects an ethical shift toward restitution even in the absence of complete documentation.\n\n\n\nThis chart tracks the number of sacred items returned each year under NAGPRA.
