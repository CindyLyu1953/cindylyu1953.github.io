Through temporal, geospatial, and institutional analysis, we explore how the return of Native American ancestral remains reflects deeper tensions between law, history, and justice.\nWith thoughtful data storytelling and visual design, we aim to honor the human lives behind the data—bringing clarity, accountability, and empathy to a story still unfolding."
